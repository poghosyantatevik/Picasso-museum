                        <strong> Pablo Picasso</strong> is probably the most important figure of the 20th century, in terms of art, and art movements that occurred over this period. Before the age of 50, the Spanish born artist had become the most well-known
                        name in modern art, with the most distinct style and eye for artistic creation. There had been no other artists, prior to Picasso, who had such an impact on the art world, or had a mass following of fans and critics alike, as he
                        did.
                        <br> Pablo Picasso was born in Spain in 1881, and was raised there before going on to spend most of his adult life working as an artist in France. Throughout the long course of his career, he created more than 20,000 paintings,
                        drawings, sculptures, ceramics and other items such as costumes and theater sets. He is universally renowned as one of the most influential and celebrated artists of the twentieth century. <br> Picasso's ability to produce works
                        in an astonishing range of styles made him well respected during his own lifetime. After his death in 1973 his value as an artist and inspiration to other artists has only grown. He is without a doubt destined to permanently etch
                        himself into the fabric of humanity as one of the greatest artists of all time. <br> As an artist and an innovator, he is responsible for co-founding the entire Cubist movement alongside Georges Braque. Cubism was an avant-garde
                        art movement that changed forever the face of European painting and sculpture while simultaneously affecting contemporary architecture, music and literature. Subjects and objects in Cubism are broken up into pieces and re-arranged
                        in an abstract form. During the period from approximately 1910-1920 when Picasso and Braque were laying the foundation for Cubism in France, its effects were so far-reaching as to inspire offshoots like the styles of Futurism,
                        Dada, and Constructivism in other countries.</p>

                                Child with a Dove is one of Picasso's earliest works: he was twenty-one, or even less, but his own style is already apparent. He probably painted it in Paris during his second visit, when he was staying with Spanish friends. In Child with a Dove, we see
                                a new thoughtfulness, a poetic sympathy with the subject, qualities that were to dominate his work in the years that followed. This painting comes well before Picasso's Blue Period - and it is perhaps the earliest of his
                                works in which he appears as a clearly defined individuality. He seems to have left his apprenticeship behind, giving us for the first time an expression of his own, not very gay vision of the world.

                                In 1954 Jacqueline moved in with Picasso and the couple married seven years later. In 1955 Picasso and Jacqueline acquired a new home called 'La Californie', situated on a hill in Cannes overlooking the Golfe Juan. Here Picasso embarked on a feverish
                                period of painting. Jacqueline was to become one of the major subjects of this period, and he pointed his new partner over and over again. Here we see Jacqueline in profile, seated with her knees tucked up to her chest.
                                The elongated neck, simple striped dress and sandals give the sitter the air of a classical goddess,

                                It took a while for Picasso to realize that Cubism could actually be deeply expressive: that the disconnection and rearrangement of parts of a person's appearance opened up vast new emotional possibilities for portraiture. You can see it from this Picasso
                                painting, Bather With Beach Ball. In this painting Picasso depicted his young mistress, Walter, as a pneumatic plaything, a floating zeppelin with a blow-up tube for her head. Although this is not the finest of Picasso's
                                paintings of Walters, it was made special because of the tender effect: <br> a kind of low relief of soft forms fading into shadow that creates an evanescent image, a face seen in the half-light
                                or as if through a scrim.
